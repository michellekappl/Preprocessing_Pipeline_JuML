Q: "is there a regex for finding digits within a string, independent of length?"
A: "Yes, there is a regex for finding digits within a string regardless of their length. The pattern is: \d+
Explanation:
    - \d matches any single digit (0-9).
    - + matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element (in this case, digits).
This means \d+ will match any sequence of consecutive digits in a string, regardless of how long the sequence is."
